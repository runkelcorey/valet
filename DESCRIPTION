Description: The Bank of Canada updated their Valet API
             <https://www.bankofcanada.ca/valet/docs>, and no R client
             currently exists. This provides access to all of Valet's endpoints
             and serves responses in wide format easy for researchers to
             handle but also provides tools to access API responses as a list.
